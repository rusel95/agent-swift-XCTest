## Installation

ReportPortalAgent is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'ReportPortal'
```
and install it:
```bash
cd <project>
pod install
```

Also available through SPM by name "agent-swift-xctest" or URL of current repo

## Report Portal properties

The properties for Report Portal configuration should be set in the `Info.plist` file of your Test Target. If you Test Target does't have an `Info.plist`, follow these steps to add:

1. In your Test Target Folder, create a Property List named `Info.plist`.
2. In Test Target Settings, configure 'Info.plist File' with the path `TestTargetFolderName/Info.plist`.

Now, you can specify the Report Portal properties:

* ReportPortalURL - URL to API of report portal (exaple https://report-portal.company.com/api/v1).
* ReportPortalToken - token for authentication which you can get from RP account settings.
* ReportPortalLaunchName - name of launch.
* Principal class - use `ReportPortalAgent.RPListener` from ReportPortalAgent lib for SPM or `ReportPortal.RPListener` for CocoaPods. You can also specify your own Observer which should conform to [XCTestObservation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest/xctestobservation) protocol.
* PushTestDataToReportPortal - can be used to switch off/on reporting
* ReportPortalProjectName - project name from Report Portal
* ReportPortalTags(optional) - can be used to specify tags, separated by comma.
* IsFinalTestBundle - use to mark last test target as YES, and all others as NO to allow single launch for them

## Optional: Test Plan Name visibility

To include test plan names in ReportPortal, add the `TEST_PLAN_NAME` environment variable to your `.xctestplan` file manually:

```json
{
  "defaultOptions": {
    "environmentVariableEntries": [
      {
        "key": "TEST_PLAN_NAME",
        "value": "Example Test Plan"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
Or in XCode:
![Alt text](./TEST_PLAN_NAME.png)

**Result:** Launch names will appear as `YourLaunchName: Example_Test_Plan` in ReportPortal.

**Note:** Spaces in test plan names are automatically replaced with underscores for better compatibility.

**CI Override:** CI can override this value: `TEST_PLAN_NAME="Nightly Tests" xcodebuild test ...`

## Parallel Test Execution (v4.0+)

Starting with v4.0, the agent fully supports **parallel test execution**, allowing you to dramatically reduce CI/CD pipeline times. Tests can be executed across multiple simulator instances simultaneously while maintaining proper test hierarchy and reporting in ReportPortal.

### ✨ Zero-Configuration Parallel Testing

**The agent works out-of-the-box with Xcode's parallel testing—no setup required!**

Just enable parallel testing in Xcode and run your tests. The agent automatically:
- ✅ Creates a **single unified launch** for all parallel workers
- ✅ Coordinates launch creation and finalization across multiple processes
- ✅ Handles workers finishing at different times
- ✅ Works with any number of workers (Xcode determines this dynamically)

**How it works:**
- Each worker auto-generates a coordinated UUID based on the process group ID (PGID)
- All workers in the same test run share the same PGID, so they automatically coordinate
- No environment variables, no pre-action scripts, no manual configuration needed

**Example:** Run 4 parallel workers with zero setup:
```bash
xcodebuild test \
  -scheme YourScheme \
  -testPlan YourTestPlan \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' \
  -parallel-testing-enabled YES \
  -maximum-parallel-testing-workers 4
```

**Result:** One launch in ReportPortal with all test results from all 4 workers.

### Advanced: Custom Launch UUID (Optional)

For advanced use cases (CI/CD, real devices, explicit control), you can optionally set a custom launch UUID:

```bash
# In Xcode scheme Pre-Action or CI/CD script:
export RP_LAUNCH_UUID="MyApp_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)_$(ps -o pgid= -p $$)"

# Then run tests:
xcodebuild test -scheme YourScheme -parallel-testing-enabled YES
```

**Benefits of custom UUID:**
- Explicit control over launch coordination
- Works across real devices (which don't support file-based fallback)
- Enables cross-machine coordination (if UUID shared externally)

**When to use:**
- ⚠️ **Not needed for 90% of simulator use cases** (auto-generation works perfectly)
- ✅ Real device parallel testing
- ✅ CI/CD pipelines with complex requirements
- ✅ Debugging coordination issues

For detailed setup instructions, see [docs/xcode-pre-action-setup.md](./docs/xcode-pre-action-setup.md).

### Requirements

- **iOS 15.0+** / **macOS 12.0+** (required for Swift Concurrency)
- **Swift 5.5+**
- **Xcode 13+**

### Configuration

#### 1. Enable Parallel Execution in Test Plan

Edit your `.xctestplan` file to enable parallelization:

```json
{
  "defaultOptions": {
    "parallelizationEnabled": true,
    "maximumParallelTestExecutionWorkers": 4
  },
  "testTargets": [
    {
      "parallelizable": true,
      "target": {
        "containerPath": "container:YourProject.xcodeproj",
        "identifier": "YOUR_TEST_TARGET_ID",
        "name": "YourUITests"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. Run Tests with Parallel Execution

**Option A: Single Device Type (Multiple Clones)**

This approach clones the same simulator multiple times. Best for consistent test environments:

```bash
xcodebuild test \
  -scheme YourScheme \
  -testPlan YourTestPlan \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' \
  -parallel-testing-enabled YES \
  -maximum-parallel-testing-workers 4
```

This will create 4 simulator clones: `iPhone 16 - Clone 1`, `iPhone 16 - Clone 2`, etc.

**Option B: Multiple Device Types (Explicit Devices)**

Run tests across different device models simultaneously. Great for device coverage:

```bash
xcodebuild test \
  -scheme YourScheme \
  -testPlan YourTestPlan \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15 Pro' \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14' \
  -parallel-testing-enabled YES
```

**Option C: GitHub Actions Example**

```yaml
- name: Run Tests in Parallel
  run: |
    xcodebuild test \
      -scheme MyApp \
      -testPlan MyTestPlan \
      -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' \
      -parallel-testing-enabled YES \
      -maximum-parallel-testing-workers 2 \
      -resultBundlePath TestResults.xcresult
```

**Option D: Bitrise Example**

```yaml
- xcode-test@4:
    inputs:
      - scheme: MyApp
      - test_plan: MyTestPlan
      - simulator_device: iPhone 16
      - xcpretty_test_options: --parallel-testing-enabled --maximum-parallel-testing-workers 3
```

### Worker Count Recommendations

Choose worker count based on your CI/CD environment:

| Environment | Recommended Workers | Reasoning |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Local Development** (8+ cores) | 4 | Balanced performance without overloading machine |
| **Local Development** (4-6 cores) | 2-3 | Prevents resource contention |
| **GitHub Actions** | 2 | Limited CI resources (7GB RAM, 2 cores) |
| **Bitrise** | 3-4 | Better resource availability |
| **Jenkins** (self-hosted) | CPU count / 2 | Scale with available hardware |
| **GitLab CI** | 2-3 | Standard runner specs |

### Verifying Parallel Execution

When tests run in parallel, you should see output like:

```
Testing started on 'iPhone 16 - Clone 1'
Testing started on 'iPhone 16 - Clone 2'
Testing started on 'iPhone 16 - Clone 3'
Testing started on 'iPhone 16 - Clone 4'
```

In ReportPortal, all test results will appear under a **single launch** with proper test hierarchy maintained.

### Performance Impact

**Example: 1000 UI tests @ 3 seconds each**

| Configuration | Execution Time | Improvement |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| Sequential (v3.x) | ~50 minutes | Baseline |
| Parallel - 2 workers | ~25 minutes | **50% faster** |
| Parallel - 4 workers | ~15 minutes | **70% faster** |

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: Tests still run sequentially**

Check that:
- Test plan has `"parallelizationEnabled": true`
- Test targets have `"parallelizable": true`
- Command line includes `-parallel-testing-enabled YES`

**Issue: Only 1 simulator visible**

The agent supports parallel execution, but simulator visibility depends on xcodebuild. Verify with:
```bash
instruments -s devices  # Should show cloned simulators during test run
```

**Issue: Flaky tests in parallel mode**

- Run with Thread Sanitizer to detect race conditions: `-enableThreadSanitizer YES`
- Check for shared state between tests (static variables, singletons)
- Use proper waits instead of hard-coded delays (`XCTAssertTrue(element.waitForExistence(timeout: 5))`)

### Sequential Execution (Backward Compatible)

To run tests sequentially (v3.x behavior):

```json
{
  "defaultOptions": {
    "parallelizationEnabled": false
  }
}
```

Or via command line:
```bash
xcodebuild test -scheme YourScheme -parallel-testing-enabled NO
```
